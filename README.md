# Autonomous Obstacle-Avoiding Robot (Prototype Build)

This is a simple autonomous robot built as a **minimum working model** for the GDG Roobotics & Embedded Systems Track. Using an ultrasonic sensor, it continuously scans its surroundings and chooses the safest direction to move.  
Despite limited components at the time, the team assembled a fully functional prototype during a study jam session.

## 🚗 Overview
The robot:
- Moves forward for a short interval  
- Pauses and scans **left, front, and right**  
- Determines the direction with the most clearance  
- Turns accordingly and continues moving  

This loop allows the robot to navigate around obstacles autonomously.
